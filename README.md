## App working Mechanism:
- This app use real time data from https://www.believescreener.com/
- I have utilized websocket data for real time token prices, by understanding how the ping pong mechanism is working on actual website.
- For the statistics , i have setup a proxy server and then serving the html from that proxy, then scraping the statistics every 10 secs .
- Proxy server is used to avoid cors error on browser.
- I have no intention to misuse or exploit the data of your website, i declare that i wont use it for my personal benefit. 

- Note: Please dont forget to give feedback after reviewing , so that i can improve , i accept your choice to reject or accept my submission.
